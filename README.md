## Concept

Objects belong to people. There can be a countless of reasons why an object is placed on the table. In this case, this object is a work tool. Why is the hatchet on the table? Maybe someone just got home from work and put it on the kitchen table, but it’s also conceivable that the work was done and also that they won’t be using it anymore. What kind of story would you think of about it?

This artwork is also part of a series in which I rework my previously painted oil paintings with modern technology.

## The original

In 2014, I painted this still life on a 40x50 canvas with oil. My teacher was Csaba Flip. He is a Munkácsy award-winning painter and teacher. I created this painting in his studio.

The composition shows a hatchet and a lamp on the kitchen table. The hatchet belongs to my carpenter father. I made it for him as a gift for her 60th birthday.

## How was it made?

I made this version in 3D with awesome Three Js library. In this interactive form, it is also valid as an independent artwork within the new-media-art genre.
